Hello, everyone!
This is my first website, so I don`t use here any frameworks/js/jQuery or other "bonuses".
As always structure is:
  1) index.html - Main page for website (I have only one page)
  2) css - folder with Cascade Style Sheets: style.css - main styles
  3) images - folder with images
  4) css/906_grid16_col.css - style for grid system
  
Thank you for attention!
